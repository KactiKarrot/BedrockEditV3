# BedrockEditV3
Minecraft Bedrock Edition interpretation of the Java Edition mod WorldEdit

I've started this project in the past, first with mcfunctions, then using BEAPI with the Gametest framework (now Scripting API) however both had issues, due to the limited nature of functions, and the fact that BEAPI is no longer being developed and is outdated. Now I've started again, just building from the ground up.
